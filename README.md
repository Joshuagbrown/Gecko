youâ€™ll need to re-enable it). To import your project:

- Select the project folder.
- Select `Import project from external model` and make sure that Maven is highlighted.

**Note:** *If you run into dependency issues when running the app or the Maven pop up doesn't appear then open the Maven sidebar and click the Refresh icon labeled 'Reimport All Maven Projects'.*
